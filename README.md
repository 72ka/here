Description:
============

Nokia released the HERE maps for desktop or mobile browsers. If you try to open their maps in webOS browser, you can´t interact with the maps. This application is simple webview container to allow user interactions. All the issues and bugs are on the Nokia side (they count with webOS, but it is still experimental). This application is unofficial, free, licenced under Apache license.
We will see how Nokia improves it...

You have to turn ON GPS before the application start, otherwise the location fix doesn´t work

Works only on webOS 2.x

webOS 1.x - web app won´t load at all

webOS 3.x - the map is only at half of the screen
